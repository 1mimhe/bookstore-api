# Bookstore API (Archived)

## Overview
This repository contains an in-progress implementation of a Bookstore API, designed to manage book-related data and user interactions, inspired by the IranKetaab platform. The project was built using **JavaScript**, **Express.js**, **Sequelize (MySQL)**, **Redis**, **AJV**, and **ElasticSearch**. This project is no longer actively maintained as it has been re-implemented in a new repository using **TypeScript**, **NestJS**, and **TypeORM** for improved type safety, scalability, and maintainability.

For the latest version of this project, please visit the [new repository](https://github.com/1mimhe/bookstore-nest).
